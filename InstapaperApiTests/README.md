# Instapaper API Tests
Tests for the Instapaper Service API Library. These tests validate in two ways:
1. Does the library produce the right output for fixed inputs
2. Can you actually interact with the Instapaper API & does it behave as
   expected

To set the keys to run these tests, see `TestUtilities.md`.
