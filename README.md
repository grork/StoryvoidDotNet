# Storyvoid, targeting .Net
This is a repo containing the code to support a .net-targeted runtime, written in C#

## API Keys
Because API keys are secrets, and unique to applications & their owners, the API
keys needed to run the applications & execute test are not included in this code.

Instead, there are placholder values in the appropriate files that need to be
changed to your real keys first.

Please see the `readme.md` in the relevant project for details on how to get keys
and where to put them.
